# Performance Consultations

Do you have a killer web app but need to squeeze out all the performance?
Not sure what to try next?

I can solve your performance problems.

I've helped many people so far. I've worked on traditional Rails
applications and modern client side apps using Ember.js. I've helped
people all across the spectrum make their apps faster and pass on
knowledge. I've never had an unsatisified customer. **Too many I's.  Make it about THEM**

If you are unsatisfied the result, I will give you 100% of your money back.

## "The brainstorm" Package

We put our heads together for an hour:

* I will review the code with you within the call.
* Show you where the problem areas are and give you ideas to fix them.

This service is **$200**. [Email me](mailto:adam@hawkins.io&subject=Caching+Consultation) if this
describes you.

** Keep it a really basic service.  $200 isn't much to arrange for the hassle of coordinating a meeting**

## The "I'll make your problems go away" package

I will take 3 hours to:
* Review the problems you have.
* Diagnose the problems.
* Fix the problems.
* Give you a report.

This service is **$800**. [Email me](mailto:adam@hawkins.io&subject=Caching+Consultation) if this
describes you.

## For coaching

I can also implement any strategies described in our consultations or
on my blog. Fast applications matter. They play huge roll in user
experience. Users love fast application. I can work 1 one 1 or with a
team implementing a custom performance strategy for your application.
This means you and I will work together so I can full understand your
application and what is important. This service **starts at $2000**. [Email
me](mailto:adam@hawkins.io&subject=Caching+Consultation) and let's
talk if this describes you.

The general consultations happen over Google Hangouts since it can be
recorded and shared with your coworkers. I'm currently living in
Europe. Consultations are usually scheduled for one or two days after
initial contact.

If you are interested please [email
me](mailto:adam@hawkins.io&subject=Caching+Consultation). I look
forward to working with you.
