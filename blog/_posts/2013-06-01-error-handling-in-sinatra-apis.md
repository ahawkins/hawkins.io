I'm constructing an API for an Ember-Data backed application. This
creates one important requirement: every communication must happen
over JSON. This includes happy path and non-happy path responses.
201's must be treated the same way as 500's. The sinatra app is set to
handle a specific set of exceptions. There are not failures, but
exceptions raise with the sole purpose of catching them. These include
errors like `RecordNotFound`, `ValidationError`, or
`PermissionDenied`. Then there are the unexpected errors--the actual
exceptions that break things. Handling these turned out to be
problematic.

Exceptions could happen in two places: inside the application or
inside middleware. Exceptions inside the app were useful. I'd start
the server with `rackup` and see a stack trace in `$stdout`. The
server would correctly respond with 500. Errors from inside the
middleware stack would simply return a 500 without anything on
`$stdout`. This had something to do with Sinatra's internals. I'm not
sure if it's a bug or a feature. I've opened an [issue](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/721)
on GitHub about this.

With those things in mind, I set out to come up with a solution for
these requirements:

* Exceptions coming from the app or middleware are logged to the
  console
* Exceptions coming from the app or middleware are rendered as JSON in
  a helpful format. The stacktrace is included in the development
  env.
* Completely ignore Rack's default `ShowExceptions` middleware. This
  causes useless HTML responses when debugging the API.
* Run simply with `rackup`

It took a couple of hours to come up with something that handled all
these cases. I went back and forth about how the Sinatra app should
work. I settled with the app only catching the exceptions it expected.
The rest would continue up the stack. Exceptions coming from
middleware would already propagate up the stack anyways. All I had to
do was implement a simple middleware to catch exceptions and render
them as JSON. This can all be encapsulated as a simple `config.ru` and
switching some settings in the Sinatra app.

With that, all errors will be logged to the console and rendered
as pretty JSON making it easy for all clients to use.
